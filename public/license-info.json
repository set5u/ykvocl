If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

For that simple use-case, you can check out [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), our batteries-included approach to deploying static sites on Cloudflare's edge network. Workers Sites was designed as a precursor to Cloudflare Pages, so check out Pages if you just want to deploy your static site without any special customizations!\n\nFor users who _do_ want to customize their assets, and want to build complex experiences on top of their static assets, `kv-asset-handler` (and the default [Workers Sites template](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), which is provided for use with Wrangler + Workers Sites) allows you to customize caching behavior, headers, and anything else about how your Workers function loads the static assets for your site stored in Workers KV.\n\nThe Cloudflare Workers Discord server is an active place where Workers users get help, share feedback, and collaborate on making our platform better. The `#workers` channel in particular is a great place to chat about `kv-asset-handler`, and building cool experiences for your users using these tools! If you have questions, want to share what you're working on, or give feedback, [join us in Discord and say hello](https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev)!\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [`getAssetFromKV`](#-getassetfromkv)\n  - [Example](#example)\n  * [Return](#return)\n  * [Optional Arguments](#optional-arguments)\n    - [`mapRequestToAsset`](#-maprequesttoasset)\n    - [Example](#example-1)\n    - [`cacheControl`](#-cachecontrol)\n      - [`browserTTL`](#browserttl)\n      - [`edgeTTL`](#edgettl)\n      - [`bypassCache`](#bypasscache)\n    - [`ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)](#asset_namespace-required-for-es-modules)\n    - [`ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)](#asset_manifest-required-for-es-modules)\n    - [`defaultETag`](#defaultetag-optional)\n\n* [Helper functions](#helper-functions)\n  - [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1)\n  - [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp)\n* [Cache revalidation and etags](#cache-revalidation-and-etags)\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this package to your `package.json` by running this in the root of your\nproject's directory:\n\n```\nnpm i @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package was designed to work with [Worker Sites](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites).\n\n## `getAssetFromKV`\n\ngetAssetFromKV(Evt) => Promise<Response>\n\n`getAssetFromKV` is an async function that takes an `Evt` object (containing a `Request` and a [`waitUntil`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#waituntil)) and returns a `Response` object if the request matches an asset in KV, otherwise it will throw a `KVError`.\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example checks for the existence of a value in KV, and returns it if it's there, and returns a 404 if it is not. It also serves index.html from `/`.\n\n### Return\n\n`getAssetFromKV` returns a `Promise<Response>` with `Response` being the body of the asset requested.\n\nKnown errors to be thrown are:\n\n- MethodNotAllowedError\n- NotFoundError\n- InternalError\n\n#### ES Modules\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, NotFoundError, MethodNotAllowedError } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\nimport manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'\nconst assetManifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)\n\nexport default {\n\tasync fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n\t\tif (request.url.includes('/docs')) {\n\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\treturn await getAssetFromKV(\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest,\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t\t\tif (e instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\t} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn new Response('An unexpected error occurred', { status: 500 })\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} else return fetch(request)\n\t},\n}\n```\n\n#### Service Worker\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, NotFoundError, MethodNotAllowedError } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n\naddEventListener('fetch', (event) => {\n\tevent.respondWith(handleEvent(event))\n})\n\nasync function handleEvent(event) {\n\tif (event.request.url.includes('/docs')) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\treturn await getAssetFromKV(event)\n\t\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t\tif (e instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\treturn new Response('An unexpected error occurred', { status: 500 })\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t} else return fetch(event.request)\n}\n```\n\n### Optional Arguments\n\nYou can customize the behavior of `getAssetFromKV` by passing the following properties as an object into the second argument.\n\n```\ngetAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: ... })\n```\n\n#### `mapRequestToAsset`\n\nmapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request\n\nMaps the incoming request to the value that will be looked up in Cloudflare's KV\n\nBy default, mapRequestToAsset is set to the exported function [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1). This works for most static site generators, but you can customize this behavior by passing your own function as `mapRequestToAsset`. The function should take a `Request` object as its only argument, and return a new `Request` object with an updated path to be looked up in the asset manifest/KV.\n\nFor SPA mapping pass in the [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp) function\n\n#### Example\n\nStrip `/docs` from any incoming request before looking up an asset in Cloudflare's KV.\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n...\nconst customKeyModifier = request => {\n  let url = request.url\n  //custom key mapping optional\n  url = url.replace('/docs', '').replace(/^\\/+/, '')\n  return mapRequestToAsset(new Request(url, request))\n}\nlet asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: customKeyModifier })\n```\n\n#### `cacheControl`\n\ntype: object\n\n`cacheControl` allows you to configure options for both the Cloudflare Cache accessed by your Worker, and the browser cache headers sent along with your Workers' responses. The default values are as follows:\n\n```javascript\nlet cacheControl = {\n\tbrowserTTL: null, // do not set cache control ttl on responses\n\tedgeTTL: 2 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 2 days\n\tbypassCache: false, // do not bypass Cloudflare's cache\n}\n```\n\n##### `browserTTL`\n\ntype: number | null\nnullable: true\n\nSets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response returned from the Worker. By default set to `null` which will not add the header at all.\n\n##### `edgeTTL`\n\ntype: number | null\nnullable: true\n\nSets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response used as the edge cache key. By default set to 2 days (`2 * 60 * 60 * 24`). When null will not cache on the edge at all.\n\n##### `bypassCache`\n\ntype: boolean\n\nDetermines whether to cache requests on Cloudflare's edge cache. By default set to `false` (recommended for production builds). Useful for development when you need to eliminate the cache's effect on testing.\n\n#### `ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)\n\ntype: KV Namespace Binding\n\nThe binding name to the KV Namespace populated with key/value entries of files for the Worker to serve. By default, Workers Sites uses a [binding to a Workers KV Namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/storage/api/#namespaces) named `__STATIC_CONTENT`.\n\nIt is further assumed that this namespace consists of static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files, keyed off of a relative path that roughly matches the assumed URL pathname of the incoming request.\n\nIn ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be gotten from `env`.\n\n##### ES Module\n\n```js\nreturn getAssetFromKV(\n\t{\n\t\trequest,\n\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,\n\t},\n)\n```\n\n##### Service Worker\n\n```\nreturn getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_NAMESPACE: MY_NAMESPACE })\n```\n\n#### `ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)\n\ntype: text blob (JSON formatted) or object\n\nThe mapping of requested file path to the key stored on Cloudflare.\n\nWorkers Sites with Wrangler bundles up a text blob that maps request paths to content-hashed keys that are generated by Wrangler as a cache-busting measure. If this option/binding is not present, the function will fallback to using the raw pathname to look up your asset in KV. If, for whatever reason, you have rolled your own implementation of this, you can include your own by passing a stringified JSON object where the keys are expected paths, and the values are the expected keys in your KV namespace.\n\nIn ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be imported.\n\n##### ES Module\n\n```js\nimport manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'\nlet manifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)\nmanifest['index.html'] = 'index.special.html'\n\nreturn getAssetFromKV(\n\t{\n\t\trequest,\n\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tASSET_MANIFEST: manifest,\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n)\n```\n\n##### Service Worker\n\n```\nlet assetManifest = { \"index.html\": \"index.special.html\" }\nreturn getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest })\n```\n\n#### `defaultMimeType` (optional)\n\ntype: string\n\nThis is the mime type that will be used for files with unrecognized or missing extensions. The default value is `'text/plain'`.\n\nIf you are serving a static site and would like to use extensionless HTML files instead of index.html files, set this to `'text/html'`.\n\n#### `defaultDocument` (optional)\n\ntype: string\n\nThis is the default document that will be concatenated for requests ends in `'/'` or without a valid mime type like `'/about'` or `'/about.me'`. The default value is `'index.html'`.\n\n#### `defaultETag` (optional)\n\ntype: `'strong' | 'weak'`\n\nThis determines the format of the response [ETag header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag). If the resource is in the cache, the ETag will always be weakened before being returned.\nThe default value is `'strong'`.\n\n# Helper functions\n\n## `mapRequestToAsset`\n\nmapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request\n\nThe default function for mapping incoming requests to keys in Cloudflare's KV.\n\nTakes any path that ends in `/` or evaluates to an HTML file and appends `index.html` or `/index.html` for lookup in your Workers KV namespace.\n\n## `serveSinglePageApp`\n\nserveSinglePageApp(Request) => Request\n\nA custom handler for mapping requests to a single root: `index.html`. The most common use case is single-page applications - frameworks with in-app routing - such as React Router, VueJS, etc. It takes zero arguments.\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, serveSinglePageApp } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n...\nlet asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: serveSinglePageApp })\n```\n\n# Cache revalidation and etags\n\nAll responses served from cache (including those with `cf-cache-status: MISS`) include an `etag` response header that identifies the version of the resource. The `etag` value is identical to the path key used in the `ASSET_MANIFEST`. It is updated each time an asset changes and looks like this: `etag: <filename>.<hash of file contents>.<extension>` (ex. `etag: index.54321.html`).\n\nResources served with an `etag` allow browsers to use the `if-none-match` request header to make conditional requests for that resource in the future. This has two major benefits:\n\n- When a request's `if-none-match` value matches the `etag` of the resource in Cloudflare cache, Cloudflare will send a `304 Not Modified` response without a body, saving bandwidth.\n- Changes to a file on the server are immediately reflected in the browser - even when the cache control directive `max-age` is unexpired.\n\n#### Disable the `etag`\n\nTo turn `etags` **off**, you must bypass cache:\n\n```js\n/* Turn etags off */\nlet cacheControl = {\n\tbypassCache: true,\n}\n```\n\n#### Syntax and comparison context\n\n`kv-asset-handler` sets and evaluates etags as [strong validators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests#Strong_validation). To preserve `etag` integrity, the format of the value deviates from the [RFC2616 recommendation to enclose the `etag` with quotation marks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.11). This is intentional. Cloudflare cache applies the `W/` prefix to all `etags` that use quoted-strings -- a process that converts the `etag` to a \"weak validator\" when served to a client.",

    "description": "A native C++ Node module for querying and subscribing to filesystem events. Used by Parcel 2.",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# @parcel/watcher\n\nA native C++ Node module for querying and subscribing to filesystem events. Used by [Parcel 2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Watch** - subscribe to realtime recursive directory change notifications when files or directories are created, updated, or deleted.\n- **Query** - performantly query for historical change events in a directory, even when your program is not running.\n- **Native** - implemented in C++ for performance and low-level integration with the operating system.\n- **Cross platform** - includes backends for macOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and Watchman.\n- **Performant** - events are throttled in C++ so the JavaScript thread is not overwhelmed during large filesystem changes (e.g. `git checkout` or `npm install`).\n- **Scalable** - tens of thousands of files can be watched or queried at once with good performance.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nconst watcher = require('@parcel/watcher');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// Subscribe to events\nlet subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {\n  console.log(events);\n});\n\n// later on...\nawait subscription.unsubscribe();\n\n// Get events since some saved snapshot in the past\nlet snapshotPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'snapshot.txt');\nlet events = await watcher.getEventsSince(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);\n\n// Save a snapshot for later\nawait watcher.writeSnapshot(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);\n```\n\n## Watching\n\n`@parcel/watcher` supports subscribing to realtime notifications of changes in a directory. It works recursively, so changes in sub-directories will also be emitted.\n\nEvents are throttled and coalesced for performance during large changes like `git checkout` or `npm install`, and a single notification will be emitted with all of the events at the end.\n\nOnly one notification will be emitted per file. For example, if a file was both created and updated since the last event, you'll get only a `create` event. If a file is both created and deleted, you will not be notifed of that file. Renames cause two events: a `delete` for the old name, and a `create` for the new name.\n\n```javascript\nlet subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {\n  console.log(events);\n});\n```\n\nEvents have two properties:\n\n- `type` - the event type: `create`, `update`, or `delete`.\n- `path` - the absolute path to the file or directory.\n\nTo unsubscribe from change notifications, call the `unsubscribe` method on the returned subscription object.\n\n```javascript\nawait subscription.unsubscribe();\n```\n\n`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:\n\n- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS\n- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed\n- [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) on Linux\n- [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) on Windows\n- [kqueue](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?kqueue) on FreeBSD, or as an alternative to FSEvents on macOS\n\nYou can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.\n\n## Querying\n\n`@parcel/watcher` also supports querying for historical changes made in a directory, even when your program is not running. This makes it easy to invalidate a cache and re-build only the files that have changed, for example. It can be **significantly** faster than traversing the entire filesystem to determine what files changed, depending on the platform.\n\nIn order to query for historical changes, you first need a previous snapshot to compare to. This can be saved to a file with the `writeSnapshot` function, e.g. just before your program exits.\n\n```javascript\nawait watcher.writeSnapshot(dirPath, snapshotPath);\n```\n\nWhen your program starts up, you can query for changes that have occurred since that snapshot using the `getEventsSince` function.\n\n```javascript\nlet events = await watcher.getEventsSince(dirPath, snapshotPath);\n```\n\nThe events returned are exactly the same as the events that would be passed to the `subscribe` callback (see above).\n\n`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:\n\n- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS\n- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed\n- [fts](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fts.3.html) (brute force) on Linux and FreeBSD\n- [FindFirstFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea) (brute force) on Windows\n\nThe FSEvents (macOS) and Watchman backends are significantly more performant than the brute force backends used by default on Linux and Windows, for example returning results in miliseconds instead of seconds for large directory trees. This is because a background daemon monitoring filesystem changes on those platforms allows us to query cached data rather than traversing the filesystem manually (brute force).\n\nmacOS has good performance with FSEvents by default. For the best performance on other platforms, install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and it will be used by `@parcel/watcher` automatically.\n\nYou can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.\n\n## Options\n\nAll of the APIs in `@parcel/watcher` support the following options, which are passed as an object as the last function argument.\n\n- `ignore` - an array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. uses [`is-glob`](https://github.com/micromatch/is-glob) to distinguish paths from globs. glob patterns are parsed with [`micromatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) (see [features](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features)).\n  - paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories. No events will be emitted about these files or directories or their children.\n  - glob patterns match on relative paths from the root that is watched. No events will be emitted for matching paths.\n- `backend` - the name of an explicitly chosen backend to use. Allowed options are `\"fs-events\"`, `\"watchman\"`, `\"inotify\"`, `\"kqueue\"`, `\"windows\"`, or `\"brute-force\"` (only for querying). If the specified backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead.\n\n## WASM\n\nThe `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package can be used in place of `@parcel/watcher` on unsupported platforms. It relies on the Node `fs` module, so in non-Node environments such as browsers, an `fs` polyfill will be needed. The `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package is published as an ESM-only module.\n\n**Note**: the WASM implementation is significantly less efficient than the native implementations because it must crawl the file system to watch each directory individually. Use the native `@parcel/watcher` package wherever possible.\n\n```js\nimport {subscribe} from '@parcel/watcher-wasm';\n\n// Use the module as documented above.\nsubscribe(/* ... */);\n```\n\n## Who is using this?\n\n- [Parcel 2](https://parceljs.org/)\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_file-watching-changes)\n- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense)\n- [Gatsby Cloud](https://twitter.com/chatsidhartha/status/1435647412828196867)\n- [Nx](https://nx.dev)\n- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# pug-browser\n\nBuilder for Pug running in Browsers. [Live Demo](https://plotdb.github.io/pug-browser/)\n\n## Usage\n\nexecute the following:\n\n```\n    npm install; npm run build\n```\n\nGenerated pug file will be available in `dist/` folder. Besides Pug, we also bundle html2pug from [this repo](https://github.com/izolate/html2pug).\n\n\n## Why\n\nClient side Pug is useful for purpose like online pug editing and realtime preview. One can simply use browserify to generate a bundle js file for running Pug in browser, yet \n\n * `fs` is not available in browser.\n * bundle file is quite huge.\n\nHere is a size statistics of a bundled pug js file, generated with discify from hughsk/disc:\n\n![module size statistics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotdb/pug-browser/master/index.png)\n\n\nFollowing are the modules to be blamed for:\n\n * constantinople - for checking if a expression is constant. for performance optimization. 445KB\n * uglify-js - use to minfiy js in pug-filters and pug-runtime. 400KB\n * clean-css - use to minify css in pug-filters. 394KB\n * with - for mimic `with` syntax. 149KB\n * is-expression - 123KB\n\nAnd the result bundle file can be 1.4MB(tinyified) to 2MB. Removing `constantinople`, `uglify-js`, `clean-css` and `with` can reduce the file size to 170KB, nearly 1/10 in size.\n\n## How\n\nWe use browserify to overwrite and replace above modules with following behavior, which could be found in `src/`:\n\n * clean-css and uglify-js - return original string without minifying.\n * constantinople - always return false for constant testing.\n * with - use language feature `with` directly.\n\n## Sample Usage\n\nPug:\n```\n    script(src=\"<path-to-pugjs>\")\n    script.\n      pug = require(\"pug\");\n      result_html = pug.render(\"header: h1.title Hello World!\", {filename: \"index.pug\", basedir: \".\"});\n```\n\nhtml2pug:\n\n```\n    script(src=\"<path-to-html2pugjs>\")\n    script.\n      html2pug = require(\"html2pug\");\n      result_pug = html2pug('<header><h1 class=\"title\">Hello World!</h1></header>')\n```\n\n\n## FileSystem\n\nWe don't provide `fs` module for browser but you can use `BrowserFS` for supporting include / extend directly in browser. Following is a sample code to make it work:\n\n```\n    script(src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/BrowserFS/2.0.0/browserfs.min.js\")\n    script(src=\"<path-to-pugjs>\")\n    script.\n      BrowserFS.install(window)\n      BrowserFS.configure({fs: \"LocalStorage\"}, function() {\n        window.fs = fs = require(\"fs\");\n        fs.writeFileSync(\"sample.pug\", \"h1 Hello World!\");\n      });\n      pug = require(\"pug\");\n      result_html = pug.render(\"include sample.pug\", {filename: \"index.pug\", basedir: \".\"});\n```\n\n## html2pug\n\nSimilarly, html2pug is built with following modules excluded:\n\n * source-map\n * stream-http\n * uglify-js\n * clean-css\n\n\n## Discussion \n\nThe minimized Pug.js works at least for some simple cases with include, var interpolation, mixin, &attributes and loop, yet It's more like just an experiment and removing these modules will possibly cause some major issues like in performance. We need more tests about it before actually using it in production site.\n\nAdditionally, since constantinople is for optimization, it's possible that we optionally use some nondeterministic algorithms as alternatives instead of including a whole js parser when size is a major concern.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.",

But consider that may not be the only instance in your codebase, and that after a refactor this might be incorrect. With this plugin in place, you can alias `../../../batman` with `batman` for readability and maintainability. In the case of a refactor, only the alias would need to be changed, rather than navigating through the codebase and changing all imports.\n\n```javascript\nimport batman from 'batman';\n```\n\nIf this seems familiar to Webpack users, it should. This is plugin mimics the `resolve.extensions` and `resolve.alias` functionality in Webpack.\n\nThis plugin will work for any file type that Rollup natively supports, or those which are [supported by third-party plugins](https://github.com/rollup/awesome#other-file-imports).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.\n\n## Install\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```console\nnpm install @rollup/plugin-alias --save-dev\n# or\nyarn add -D @rollup/plugin-alias\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:\n\n```js\nimport alias from '@rollup/plugin-alias';\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    dir: 'output',\n    format: 'cjs'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    alias({\n      entries: [\n        { find: 'utils', replacement: '../../../utils' },\n        { find: 'batman-1.0.0', replacement: './joker-1.5.0' }\n      ]\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nThen call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api). If the build produces any errors, the plugin will write a 'alias' character to stderr, which should be audible on most systems.\n\n## Options\n\n### `customResolver`\n\nType: `Function | Object`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nInstructs the plugin to use an alternative resolving algorithm, rather than the Rollup's resolver. Please refer to the [Rollup documentation](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#resolveid) for more information about the `resolveId` hook. For a detailed example, see: [Custom Resolvers](#custom-resolvers).\n\n### `entries`\n\nType: `Object | Array[...Object]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nSpecifies an `Object`, or an `Array` of `Object`, which defines aliases used to replace values in `import` or `require` statements. With either format, the order of the entries is important, in that the first defined rules are applied first. This option also supports [Regular Expression Alias](#regular-expression-aliases) matching.\n\n_Note: Entry targets (the object key in the Object Format, or the `find` property value in the Array Format below) should not end with a trailing slash in most cases. If strange behavior is observed, double check the entries being passed in options._\n\n#### `Object` Format\n\nThe `Object` format allows specifying aliases as a key, and the corresponding value as the actual `import` value. For example:\n\n```js\nalias({\n  entries: {\n    utils: '../../../utils',\n    'batman-1.0.0': './joker-1.5.0'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### `Array[...Object]` Format\n\nThe `Array[...Object]` format allows specifying aliases as objects, which can be useful for complex key/value pairs.\n\n```js\nentries: [\n  { find: 'utils', replacement: '../../../utils' },\n  { find: 'batman-1.0.0', replacement: './joker-1.5.0' }\n];\n```\n\n## Regular Expression Aliases\n\nRegular Expressions can be used to search in a more distinct and complex manner. e.g. To perform partial replacements via sub-pattern matching.\n\nTo remove something in front of an import and append an extension, use a pattern such as:\n\n```js\n{ find:/^i18n\\!(.*)/, replacement: '$1.js' }\n```\n\nThis would be useful for loaders, and files that were previously transpiled via the AMD module, to properly handle them in rollup as internals.\n\nTo replace extensions with another, a pattern like the following might be used:\n\n```js\n{ find:/^(.*)\\.js$/, replacement: '$1.alias' }\n```\n\nThis would replace the file extension for all imports ending with `.js` to `.alias`.\n\n## Resolving algorithm\n\nThis plugin uses resolver plugins specified for Rollup and eventually Rollup default algorithm. If you rely on Node specific features, you probably want [@rollup/plugin-node-resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-node-resolve) in your setup.\n\n## Custom Resolvers\n\nThe `customResolver` option can be leveraged to provide separate module resolution for an individual alias.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n// rollup.config.js\nimport alias from '@rollup/plugin-alias';\nimport resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';\n\nconst customResolver = resolve({\n  extensions: ['.mjs', '.js', '.jsx', '.json', '.sass', '.scss']\n});\nconst projectRootDir = path.resolve(__dirname);\n\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    alias({\n      entries: [\n        {\n          find: 'src',\n          replacement: path.resolve(projectRootDir, 'src')\n          // OR place `customResolver` here. See explanation below.\n        }\n      ],\n      customResolver\n    }),\n    resolve()\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nIn the example above the alias `src` is used, which uses the `node-resolve` algorithm for files _aliased_ with `src`, by passing the `customResolver` option. The `resolve()` plugin is kept separate in the plugins list for other files which are not _aliased_ with `src`. The `customResolver` option can be passed inside each `entries` item for granular control over resolving allowing each alias a preferred resolver.\n\n## Meta\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[LICENSE (MIT)](/LICENSE)",

For complex values, use `JSON.stringify`. To replace a target with a value that will be evaluated as a string, set the value to a quoted string (e.g. `\"test\"`) or use `JSON.stringify` to preprocess the target string safely._\n\nTypically, `@rollup/plugin-replace` should be placed in `plugins` _before_ other plugins so that they may apply optimizations, such as dead code removal.\n\n## Options\n\nIn addition to the properties and values specified for replacement, users may also specify the options below.\n\n### `delimiters`\n\nType: `Array[String, String]`<br>\nDefault: `['\\\\b', '\\\\b(?!\\\\.)']`\n\nSpecifies the boundaries around which strings will be replaced. By default, delimiters are [word boundaries](https://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html) and also prevent replacements of instances with nested access. See [Word Boundaries](#word-boundaries) below for more information.\nFor example, if you pass `typeof window` in `values` to-be-replaced, then you could expect the following scenarios:\n\n- `typeof window` **will** be replaced\n- `typeof window.document` **will not** be replaced due to `(?!\\.)` boundary\n- `typeof windowSmth` **will not** be replaced due to a `\\b` boundary\n\nDelimiters will be used to build a `Regexp`. To match special characters (any of `.*+?^${}()|[]\\`), be sure to [escape](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#escaping) them.\n\n### `objectGuards`\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nWhen replacing dot-separated object properties like `process.env.NODE_ENV`, will also replace `typeof process` object guard\nchecks against the objects with the string `\"object\"`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nreplace({\n  values: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"production\"'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// Input\nif (typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  console.log('production');\n}\n// Without `objectGuards`\nif (typeof process !== 'undefined' && 'production' === 'production') {\n  console.log('production');\n}\n// With `objectGuards`\nif ('object' !== 'undefined' && 'production' === 'production') {\n  console.log('production');\n}\n```\n\n### `preventAssignment`\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nPrevents replacing strings where they are followed by a single equals sign. For example, where the plugin is called as follows:\n\n```js\nreplace({\n  values: {\n    'process.env.DEBUG': 'false'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nObserve the following code:\n\n```js\n// Input\nprocess.env.DEBUG = false;\nif (process.env.DEBUG == true) {\n  //\n}\n// Without `preventAssignment`\nfalse = false; // this throws an error because false cannot be assigned to\nif (false == true) {\n  //\n}\n// With `preventAssignment`\nprocess.env.DEBUG = false;\nif (false == true) {\n  //\n}\n```\n\n### `exclude`\n\nType: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nA [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.\n\n### `include`\n\nType: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nA [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.\n\n### `values`\n\nType: `{ [key: String]: Replacement }`, where `Replacement` is either a string or a `function` that returns a string.\nDefault: `{}`\n\nTo avoid mixing replacement strings with the other options, you can specify replacements in the `values` option. For example, the following signature:\n\n```js\nreplace({\n  include: ['src/**/*.js'],\n  changed: 'replaced'\n});\n```\n\nCan be replaced with:\n\n```js\nreplace({\n  include: ['src/**/*.js'],\n  values: {\n    changed: 'replaced'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Word Boundaries\n\nBy default, values will only match if they are surrounded by _word boundaries_.\n\nConsider the following options and build file:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...\n  plugins: [replace({ changed: 'replaced' })]\n};\n```\n\n```js\n// file.js\nconsole.log('changed');\nconsole.log('unchanged');\n```\n\nThe result would be:\n\n```js\n// file.js\nconsole.log('replaced');\nconsole.log('unchanged');\n```\n\nTo ignore word boundaries and replace every instance of the string, wherever it may be, specify empty strings as delimiters:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  ...\n  plugins: [\n    replace({\n      changed: 'replaced',\n      delimiters: ['', '']\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n## Meta\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[LICENSE (MIT)](/LICENSE)",

Small modules [can be imported synchronously](#synchronous-modules).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.\n\n## Install\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```console\nnpm install @rollup/plugin-wasm --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:\n\n```js\nimport { wasm } from '@rollup/plugin-wasm';\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    dir: 'output',\n    format: 'cjs'\n  },\n  plugins: [wasm()]\n};\n```\n\nThen call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).\n\n## Options\n\n### `exclude`\n\nType: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nA [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.\n\n### `include`\n\nType: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nA [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all wasm files are targeted.\n\n### `sync`\n\nType: `Array[...String]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nSpecifies an array of strings that each represent a WebAssembly file to load synchronously. See [Synchronous Modules](#synchronous-modules) for a functional example.\n\n### `maxFileSize`\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `14336` (14kb)\n\nThe maximum file size for inline files. If a file exceeds this limit, it will be copied to the destination folder and loaded from a separate file at runtime. If `maxFileSize` is set to `0` all files will be copied.\n\nFiles specified in `sync` to load synchronously are always inlined, regardless of size.\n\n### `fileName`\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `'[hash][extname]'`\n\nThis option can be used to rename the emitted Wasm files. It accepts the following string replacements:\n\n- `[hash]` - The hash value of the file's contents\n- `[name]` - The name of the imported file (without its file extension)\n- `[extname]` - The extension of the imported file (including the leading `.`)\n\n### `publicPath`\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: (empty string)\n\nA string which will be added in front of filenames when they are not inlined but are copied.\n\n### `targetEnv`\n\nType: `\"auto\" | \"browser\" | \"node\"`<br>\nDefault: `\"auto\"`\n\nConfigures what code is emitted to instantiate the Wasm (both inline and separate):\n\n- `\"auto\"` will determine the environment at runtime and invoke the correct methods accordingly\n- `\"auto-inline\"` always inlines the Wasm and will decode it according to the environment\n- `\"browser\"` omits emitting code that requires node.js builtin modules that may play havoc on downstream bundlers\n- `\"node\"` omits emitting code that requires `fetch`\n\n## Usage\n\nThis plugin looks for `import` statements where the file specifier ends with `.wasm`, such as:\n\n```js\nimport wasm from './example.wasm';\n```\n\nThe WebAssembly is inlined as a base64 encoded string. At runtime the string is decoded and a module is returned.\n\n_Note: The base64 string that represents the WebAssembly within the bundle will be ~33% larger than the original file._\n\nWhen bundled, `wasm` is a function you can use to instantiate the functionality inside of the WebAssembly module. This function returns a promise, so you can instantiate the module like this:\n\n```js\nimport wasm from './example.wasm';\n\nwasm().then(({ instance }) => {\n  // use instance\n});\n\n// or use top-level await\nconst { instance } = await wasm();\n```\n\nThe promise returns an object with an `instance` property that is a [`WebAssembly.Module`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Module) object that you can use to interact with the WebAssembly module.\n\nFor example, given the following simple C file:\n\n```c\nint main() {\n  return 42;\n}\n```\n\nCompile the file using `emscripten`, or the online [WasmFiddle](https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/) tool. Then import and instantiate the resulting file:\n\n```js\nimport sample from './sample.wasm';\n\nsample().then(({ instance }) => {\n  console.log(instance.exports.main());\n});\n```\n\n### Passing Imports and Memory\n\nIf you'd like to pass any imports or memory into your WebAssembly module, you can do so by passing those as arguments to the WebAssembly loader function, like this:\n\n```js\nimport sample from './sample.wasm';\n\nconst memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 10, maximum: 100 });\n\nconst options = {\n  js: {\n    mem: memory\n  },\n  imports: {\n    log: (arg) => console.log(arg)\n  }\n};\n\nsample(options).then(({ instance }) => {\n  console.log(instance.exports.main());\n});\n```\n\nBecause this example passes in `imports`, the `instance` becomes an instance of [`WebAssembly.Instance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Instance) and gives the WebAssembly code access to the imports and memory from JavaScript.\n\n\\_\\_Note: Just passing in memory will result in a `WebAssembly.Module` as `instance`; it's only `imports` that triggers the creation of `WebAssembly.Instance`.\n\n### Using with wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack\n\nIf you are writing Rust code and using [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) or [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack), you'll need to use a different process for instantiating your WebAssembly modules. Because WebAssembly files generated by these tools require specific imports, you cannot provide these yourself.\n\nThe best setting to use with `wasm-bindgen` or `wasm-pack` is `--target web`. This will generate your WebAssembly files (such as `sample_bg.wasm`) with a JavaScript wrapper (such as `sample.js`). The JavaScript wrapper contains all of the instantiation code you'll need.\n\nYou'll need to import both the JavaScript file and the WebAssembly file into your project. Then, run the WebAssembly loading function and pass that into the `init()` function from the JavaScript file. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nimport init, { main } from '../build/sample.js';\nimport sample from '../build/sample_bg.wasm';\n\nsample()\n  .then({ instance } => init(instance))\n  .then(() => main());\n\n// or using top-level await\n\nawait init(await sample());\nmain();\n```\n\nUnlike with the `emscripten` example, you'll need to import the methods you want to use directly from the JavaScript file rather than accessing them on the `WebAssembly.Instance`.\n\n### Synchronous Modules\n\nJavaScript runtimes allow small modules (< 4KB) to be compiled synchronously. If you'd like to specify some files to be compiled synchronously, you can do so in your `rollup.config.js` file.\n\n```js\nimport { wasm } from '@rollup/plugin-wasm';\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    dir: 'output',\n    format: 'cjs'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    wasm({\n      sync: ['web/sample.wasm', 'web/foobar.wasm']\n    });\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nSynchronous modules return a synchronous loader function that returns either a `WebAssembly.Module` or `WebAssembly.Instance` directly (not a promise). So you can use the module directly, like this:\n\n```js\nimport sample from './sample.wasm';\n\nconst instance = sample({ ...imports });\n\nconsole.log(instance.exports.main());\n```\n\n## Meta\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[LICENSE (MIT)](/LICENSE)",

Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.\n\nParameters: `(ast: Node, propertyName?: String)`<br>\nReturns: `Object`\n\nSee [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.\n\n```js\nimport { attachScopes } from '@rollup/pluginutils';\nimport { walk } from 'estree-walker';\n\nexport default function myPlugin(options = {}) {\n  return {\n    transform(code) {\n      const ast = this.parse(code);\n\n      let scope = attachScopes(ast, 'scope');\n\n      walk(ast, {\n        enter(node) {\n          if (node.scope) scope = node.scope;\n\n          if (!scope.contains('foo')) {\n            // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,\n            // we assume it's a global\n          }\n        },\n        leave(node) {\n          if (node.scope) scope = scope.parent;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### createFilter\n\nConstructs a filter function which can be used to determine whether or not certain modules should be operated upon.\n\nParameters: `(include?: <picomatch>, exclude?: <picomatch>, options?: Object)`<br>\nReturns: `String`\n\n#### `include` and `exclude`\n\nType: `String | RegExp | Array[...String|RegExp]`<br>\n\nA valid [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features) pattern, or array of patterns. If `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match one or more of the `picomatch` patterns, and must not match any of the `options.exclude` patterns.\n\nNote that `picomatch` patterns are very similar to [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#readme) patterns, and in most use cases, they are interchangeable. If you have more specific pattern matching needs, you can view [this comparison table](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#library-comparisons) to learn more about where the libraries differ.\n\n#### `options`\n\n##### `resolve`\n\nType: `String | Boolean | null`\n\nOptionally resolves the patterns against a directory other than `process.cwd()`. If a `String` is specified, then the value will be used as the base directory. Relative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can be useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```js\nimport { createFilter } from '@rollup/pluginutils';\n\nexport default function myPlugin(options = {}) {\n  // assume that the myPlugin accepts options of `options.include` and `options.exclude`\n  var filter = createFilter(options.include, options.exclude, {\n    resolve: '/my/base/dir'\n  });\n\n  return {\n    transform(code, id) {\n      if (!filter(id)) return;\n\n      // proceed with the transformation...\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### dataToEsm\n\nTransforms objects into tree-shakable ES Module imports.\n\nParameters: `(data: Object)`<br>\nReturns: `String`\n\n#### `data`\n\nType: `Object`\n\nAn object to transform into an ES module.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```js\nimport { dataToEsm } from '@rollup/pluginutils';\n\nconst esModuleSource = dataToEsm(\n  {\n    custom: 'data',\n    to: ['treeshake']\n  },\n  {\n    compact: false,\n    indent: '\\t',\n    preferConst: true,\n    objectShorthand: true,\n    namedExports: true\n  }\n);\n/*\nOutputs the string ES module source:\n  export const custom = 'data';\n  export const to = ['treeshake'];\n  export default { custom, to };\n*/\n```\n\n### extractAssignedNames\n\nExtracts the names of all assignment targets based upon specified patterns.\n\nParameters: `(param: Node)`<br>\nReturns: `Array[...String]`\n\n#### `param`\n\nType: `Node`\n\nAn `acorn` AST Node.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```js\nimport { extractAssignedNames } from '@rollup/pluginutils';\nimport { walk } from 'estree-walker';\n\nexport default function myPlugin(options = {}) {\n  return {\n    transform(code) {\n      const ast = this.parse(code);\n\n      walk(ast, {\n        enter(node) {\n          if (node.type === 'VariableDeclarator') {\n            const declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);\n            // do something with the declared names\n            // e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ...` => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### makeLegalIdentifier\n\nConstructs a bundle-safe identifier from a `String`.\n\nParameters: `(str: String)`<br>\nReturns: `String`\n\n#### Usage\n\n```js\nimport { makeLegalIdentifier } from '@rollup/pluginutils';\n\nmakeLegalIdentifier('foo-bar'); // 'foo_bar'\nmakeLegalIdentifier('typeof'); // '_typeof'\n```\n\n### normalizePath\n\nConverts path separators to forward slash.\n\nParameters: `(filename: String)`<br>\nReturns: `String`\n\n#### Usage\n\n```js\nimport { normalizePath } from '@rollup/pluginutils';\n\nnormalizePath('foo\\\\bar'); // 'foo/bar'\nnormalizePath('foo/bar'); // 'foo/bar'\n```\n\n## Meta\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[LICENSE (MIT)](/LICENSE)",

The translations are loaded into the main process by VS Code itself.\n\n## Usage\n\n```typescript\nimport * as l10n from '@vscode/l10n';\n\n// Load the translations for the current locale\nl10n.config({\n    contents: JSON.parse(process.env.BUNDLE_FROM_EXTENSION)\n});\n// or\nl10n.config({\n    fsPath: process.env.FSPATH_TO_BUNDLE_FROM_EXTENSION\n});\n// or (warning, this is async)\nawait l10n.config({\n    uri: JSON.parse(process.env.BUNDLE_URI_FROM_EXTENSION)\n});\n\n// returns the translated string or the original string if no translation is available\nl10n.t('Hello World');\n\n// supports arguments just like the vscode API\nl10n.t('Hello {0}', 'John');\n\n// supports comments for translators\nl10n.t({\n    message: 'Hello {0}',\n    args: ['John'],\n    comment: ['This is a comment']\n});\n```\n\nThe input for `l10n.conig` pairs nicely with the `bundle` and `uri` properties on the `l10n` namespace that are provided by the [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#l10n).\nYou should send the value of one of these properties from your extension to your subprocess that is consuming `@vscode/l10n`.",

    "licenseText": "agent-base\n==========\n### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance\n\nThis module is a thin wrapper around the base `http.Agent` class.\n\nIt provides an abstract class that must define a `connect()` function,\nwhich is responsible for creating the underlying socket that the HTTP\nclient requests will use.\n\nThe `connect()` function may return an arbitrary `Duplex` stream, or\nanother `http.Agent` instance to delegate the request to, and may be\nasynchronous (by defining an `async` function).\n\nInstances of this agent can be used with the `http` and `https`\nmodules. To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`\nfunction includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked\nto determine what type of socket should be returned.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`\nbased on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both\nthe `http` and `https` modules.\n\n```ts\nimport * as net from 'net';\nimport * as tls from 'tls';\nimport * as http from 'http';\nimport { Agent } from 'agent-base';\n\nclass MyAgent extends Agent {\n  connect(req, opts) {\n    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the \"https\" module\n    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n      return tls.connect(opts);\n    } else {\n      return net.connect(opts);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be\n// invoked when a new connection needs to be created\nconst agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });\n\n// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request\nhttp.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: ../http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: ../https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: ../pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: ../socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

    "licenseText": "A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible? (1)\n\n    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.",

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.

For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "description": "Unsigned integers for Javascript",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# C-like unsigned integers for Javascript\n\n## Synopsis\n\nJavascript does not natively support handling of unsigned 32 or 64 bits integers. This library provides that functionality, following C behaviour, enabling the writing of algorithms that depend on it. It was designed with performance in mind and tries its best to be as fast as possible. Any improvement is welcome!\n\n\n## How it works\n\nAn unsigned 32 bits integer is represented by an object with its first 16 bits (low bits) and its 16 last ones (high bits). All the supported standard operations on the unsigned integer are then performed transparently.\n\n\te.g.\n\t10000010000100000100010000100010 (2182104098 or 0x82104422) is represented by:\n\thigh=1000001000010000\n\tlow= 0100010000100010\n\nNB.\nIn case of overflow, the unsigned integer is _truncated_ to its lowest 32 bits (in case of UINT32) or 64  bits (in case of UINT64).\n\nThe same applies to 64 bits integers, which are split into 4 16 bits ones.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn nodejs:\n\n    npm install cuint\n\nIn the browser, include the following (file is located in the _build_ directory), and access the constructor with _UINT32_:\n\n`<script src=\"/your/path/to/uint32.js\"></script>\n...\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var v1 = UINT32('326648991');\n  var v2 = UINT32('265443576');\n  var v1plus2 = v1.add(v2) // 592092567\n</script>`\n\n## Usage\n\nTo instantiate an unsigned 32 bits integer, do any of the following:\n\n\tvar UINT32 = require('cuint').UINT32 // NodeJS\n\tUINT32( <low bits>, <high bits> )\n\tUINT32( <number> )\n\tUINT32( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default\n\nTo instantiate an unsigned 64 bits integer, do any of the following:\n\n\tvar UINT64 = require('cuint').UINT64 // NodeJS\n\tUINT64( <low bits>, <high bits> )\n\tUINT64( <first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits> )\n\tUINT64( <number> )\n\tUINT64( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default\n\n## Important\n\nMost methods __do modify__ the object they are applied to. For instance, the following is equivalent to `x += y`\n\n\tUINT(x).add( UINT(y) )\n\nThis allows for chaining and reduces the cost of the emulation.\nTo have `z = x + y`, do the following:\n\n    z = UINT(x).clone().add( UINT(y) )\n\n## Examples for UINT32\n\n* Using low and high bits\n> `UINT32( 2, 1 )\t\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)\n> `UINT32( 65538 ) \t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using a string\n> `UINT32( '65538' )\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using another string\n> `UINT32( '3266489917' )`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 44605, _high: 49842 }\n\n* Divide 2 unsigned 32 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided\n> `UINT32( '3266489917' ).div( UINT32( '668265263' ) )`\n> {\tremainder:\n>\t\t\t{\tremainder: null\n>\t\t\t,\t_low: 385\n>\t\t\t,\t_high: 9055\n>\t\t\t}\n>\t,\t_low: 4\n>\t,\t_high: 0\n>\t}\n\n## Examples for UINT64\n\n* Using low and high bits\n> `UINT64( 2, 1 )\t\t// 4294967298`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 0, _a32: 1, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using first/second low and high bits\n> `UINT64( 2, 1, 0, 0 )\t\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)\n> `UINT64( 65538 ) \t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using a string\n> `UINT64( '65538' )\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using another string\n> `UINT64( '3266489917' )`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 44605, _a16: 49842, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Divide 2 unsigned 64 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided\n> `UINT64( 'F00000000000', 16 ).div( UINT64( '800000000000', 16 ) )`\n> { remainder: \n>   { remainder: null,\n>     _a00: 0,\n>     _a16: 0,\n>     _a32: 28672,\n>     _a48: 0 },\n>  _a00: 1,\n>  _a16: 0,\n>  _a32: 0,\n>  _a48: 0 }\n\n## Methods\n\nMethods specific to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:\n\n* `UINT32.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT32_ object with its low and high bits\n* `UINT64.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT64_ object with its low and high bits\n* `UINT64.fromBits(<first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT64_ object with all its low and high bits\n\nMethods common to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:\n\n* `UINT.fromNumber(<number>)*`\nSet the current _UINT_ object from a number (first 32 bits only)\n* `UINT.fromString(<string>, <radix>)`\nSet the current _UINT_ object from a string\n* `UINT.toNumber()`\nConvert this _UINT_ to a number\n* `UINT.toString(<radix>)`\nConvert this _UINT_ to a string\n* `UINT.add(<uint>)*`\nAdd two _UINT_.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\n     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\n     such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n        Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n     under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not\n      distributed with this file, You can\n      obtain one at\n      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then\nYou may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant\ndirectory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible\n      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by\n      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.",

The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.\n\n\n## Tests\n\n`$ npm test`\n\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).",

Available in npm as *errno*.\n\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n\n* [errno exposed](#errnoexposed)\n* [Custom errors](#customerrors)\n\n<a name=\"errnoexposed\"></a>\n## errno exposed\n\nEver find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "https-proxy-agent\n================\n### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified\nHTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.\n\nSpecifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary \"proxy\"\nserver and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to\nopen a direct TCP connection to the destination server.\n\nSince this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other\nprotocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).\nSee the \"Examples\" section below for more.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### `https` module example\n\n```ts\nimport * as https from 'https';\nimport { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\nconst agent = new HttpsProxyAgent('http://168.63.76.32:3128');\n\nhttps.get('https://example.com', { agent }, (res) => {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `ws` WebSocket connection example\n\n```ts\nimport WebSocket from 'ws';\nimport { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\nconst agent = new HttpsProxyAgent('http://168.63.76.32:3128');\nconst socket = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org', { agent });\n\nsocket.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('\"open\" event!');\n  socket.send('hello world');\n});\n\nsocket.on('message', function (data, flags) {\n  console.log('\"message\" event! %j %j', data, flags);\n  socket.close();\n});\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy: string | URL, options?: HttpsProxyAgentOptions)\n\nThe `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects\nto the specified \"HTTP(s) proxy server\" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket\nrequests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `proxy` argument is the URL for the proxy server.\n\nThe `options` argument accepts the usual `http.Agent` constructor options, and\nsome additional properties:\n\n * `headers` - Object containing additional headers to send to the proxy server\n   in the `CONNECT` request.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "Inquirer.js\n===========\n\n[![npm](https://badge.fury.io/js/inquirer.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/inquirer) [![tests](https://travis-ci.org/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) [![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js.svg?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js)\n\nA collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.\n\n\n## Goal and Philosophy\n\n<img align=\"right\" alt=\"Inquirer Logo\" src=\"/assets/inquirer_readme.png\" title=\"Inquirer.js\"/>\n\n**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the \"CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_(Citizen_Kane))\").\n\n**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of\n- providing *error feedback*\n- *asking questions*\n- *parsing* input\n- *validating* answers\n- managing *hierarchical prompts*\n\n> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface, and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [Commander.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js) or [Vorpal.js](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Installation\n\n``` shell\nnpm install inquirer\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar inquirer = require(\"inquirer\");\ninquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */], function( answers ) {\n\t// Use user feedback for... whatever!!\n});\n```\n\n\n### Examples (Run it and see it)\nCheckout the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.\n\n``` shell\nnode examples/pizza.js\nnode examples/checkbox.js\n# etc...\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\n`inquirer.prompt( questions, callback )`\n\nLaunch the prompt interface (inquiry session)\n\n- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)\n- **callback** (Function) first parameter is the [Answers Object](#answers)\n\n\n### Objects\n\n#### Question\nA question object is a `hash` containing question related values:\n\n- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,\n`list`, `rawlist`, `password`\n- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash.\n- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\nArray values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).\n- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.\n- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.\n- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.\n\n`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronously using `this.async()`. You just have to pass the value you'd normally return to the callback option.\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  validate: function(input) {\n\n    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback\n    var done = this.async();\n\n    // Do async stuff\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      if (typeof input !== \"number\") {\n        // Pass the return value in the done callback\n        done(\"You need to provide a number\");\n        return;\n      }\n      // Pass the return value in the done callback\n      done(true);\n    }, 3000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Answers\nA key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.\n\n- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object\n- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)\n  - `confirm`: (Boolean)\n  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)\n  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)\n\n### Separator\nA separator can be added to any `choices` array:\n\n```\n// In the question object\nchoices: [ \"Choice A\", new inquirer.Separator(), \"choice B\" ]\n\n// Which'll be displayed this way\n[?] What do you want to do?\n > Order a pizza\n   Make a reservation\n   --------\n   Ask opening hours\n   Talk to the receptionist\n```\n\nThe constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.\n\nSeparator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.\n\nPrompts type\n---------------------\n\n> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._\n\n#### List - `{ type: \"list\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)\n\n![List prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/list-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Raw List - `{ type: \"rawlist\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must the choice `index` in the array)\n\n![Raw list prompt](https://i.cloudup.com/LcRGpXI0CX-3000x3000.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Expand - `{ type: \"expand\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array)\n\nNote that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.\n\nSee `examples/expand.js` for a running example.\n\n![Expand prompt closed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-1.png)\n![Expand prompt expanded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-2.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Checkbox - `{ type: \"checkbox\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.\n\nChoices marked as `{ checked: true }` will be checked by default.\n\nChoices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `\"Disabled\"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.\n\n![Checkbox prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/checkbox-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Confirm - `{ type: \"confirm\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.\n\n![Confirm prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/confirm-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Input - `{ type: \"input\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Input prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/input-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Password - `{ type: \"password\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Password prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/password-prompt.png)\n\n## User Interfaces and layouts\n\nAlong with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.\n\n#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`\n\nThis UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.\n\n```javascript\nvar ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();\n\n// pipe a Stream to the log zone\noutputStream.pipe( ui.log );\n\n// Or simply write output\nui.log.write(\"something just happened.\");\nui.log.write(\"Almost over, standby!\");\n\n// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader\n// or output a progress bar, etc\nui.updateBottomBar(\"new bottom bar content\");\n```\n\n#### Prompt - `inquirer.ui.Prompt`\n\nThis is UI layout used to run prompt. This layout is returned by `inquirer.prompt` and you should probably always use `inquirer.prompt` to interface with this UI.\n\n\n## Reactive interface\n\nInternally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.\n\nThis mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:\n\n```js\nvar prompts = Rx.Observable.create(function( obs ) {\n  obs.onNext({ /* question... */ });\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    obs.onNext({ /* question... */ });\n    obs.onCompleted();\n  });\n});\n\ninquirer.prompt(prompts);\n```\n\nAnd using the `process` property, you have access to more fine grained callbacks:\n\n```js\ninquirer.prompt(prompts).process.subscribe(\n  onEachAnswer,\n  onError,\n  onComplete\n);\n```\n\n## Support (OS Terminals)\n\nYou should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't\nlook at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!\n\n- **Mac OS**:\n  - Terminal.app\n  - iTerm\n- **Windows**:\n  - cmd.exe\n  - Powershell\n  - Cygwin\n- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:\n  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)\n  - konsole\n\n\n## News on the march (Release notes)\n\nPlease refer to the [Github releases section for the changelog](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n**Style Guide**\nPlease brief yourself on [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js) style guide with two space indent\n\n**Unit test**\nUnit test are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Please add a unit test for every new feature or bug fix. `npm test` to run the test suite.\n\n**Documentation**\nAdd documentation for every API change. Feel free to send corrections\nor better docs!\n\n**Pull Requests**\nSend _fixes_ PR on the `master` branch. Any new features should be send on the `wip`branch.\n\nWe're looking to offer good support for multiple prompts and environments. If you want to\nhelp, we'd like to keep a list of testers for each terminal/OS so we can contact you and\nget feedback before release. Let us know if you want to be added to the list (just tweet\nto @vaxilart) or just add your name to [the wiki](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/wiki/Testers)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Simon Boudrias (twitter: @vaxilart)\nLicensed under the MIT license.",

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\n\n- Isn't bloated\n- Has a simple Promise based API\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\n- Supports namespaces\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall Keyv.\n\n```\nnpm install --save keyv\n```\n\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\n\n```\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\n```\n\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\n// One of the following\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\nconst keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('etcd://localhost:2379');\n\n// Handle DB connection errors\nkeyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));\n\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true\nawait keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'\nawait keyv.delete('foo'); // true\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\n```\n\n### Namespaces\n\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\n\n```js\nconst users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });\nconst cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });\n\nawait users.set('foo', 'users'); // true\nawait cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true\nawait users.get('foo'); // 'users'\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\nawait users.get('foo'); // undefined\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\n```\n\n### Custom Serializers\n\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\n\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\n\n```js\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\n```\n\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\n\n## Official Storage Adapters\n\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\n\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\n---|---|---\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\n\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\n\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');\n\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\n```\n\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\n\n```js\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\n```\n\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');\n\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\n```\n\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\n\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \"Least Recently Used\" (LRU) cache\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-arango](https://github.com/TimMikeladze/keyv-arango) - ArangoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-momento](https://github.com/momentohq/node-keyv-adaptor/) - Momento storage adapter for Keyv\n\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\n\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\n\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\n\nInside your module:\n\n```js\nclass AwesomeModule {\n\tconstructor(opts) {\n\t\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\n\t\t\turi: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tnamespace: 'awesome-module'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow it can be consumed like this:\n\n```js\nconst AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');\n\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\n\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });\n\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\n```\n\n## Compression\n\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\n\n```js\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\n\n### Want to build your own? \n\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\n\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync serialize(value: any);\n\tasync deserialize(value: any);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\n\n```js\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require('@keyv/test-suite');\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\n\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\n```\n\n## API\n\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\n\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\n\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\n\n### uri\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThe connection string URI.\n\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\n\n### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\n\n#### options.namespace\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `'keyv'`\n\nNamespace for the current instance.\n\n#### options.ttl\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\n\n#### options.compression\n\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\n\n#### options.serialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\n\nA custom serialization function.\n\n#### options.deserialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\n\nA custom deserialization function.\n\n#### options.store\n\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\nDefault: `new Map()`\n\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\n\n#### options.adapter\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.\n\n### Instance\n\nKeys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.\n\n#### .set(key, value, [ttl])\n\nSet a value.\n\nBy default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true`.\n\n#### .get(key, [options])\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.\n\n##### options.raw\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.\n\nThis contains the TTL timestamp.\n\n#### .delete(key)\n\nDeletes an entry.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.\n\n#### .clear()\n\nDelete all entries in the current namespace.\n\nReturns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.\n\n#### .iterator()\n\nIterate over all entries of the current namespace.\n\nReturns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:\n\n```js\n// please note that the \"await\" keyword should be used here\nfor await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {\n  console.log(key, value);\n};\n```\n\n# How to Contribute\n\nIn this section of the documentation we will cover:\n\n1) How to set up this repository locally\n2) How to get started with running commands\n3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package requires the following dependencies to run:\n\n1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n\n## Setting up your workspace\n\nTo contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:\n\n1) Fork this repository into your Git account\n2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`\n3) Install any of the above missing dependencies\n\n## Launching the project\n\nOnce the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:\n\n1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.\n2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.\n3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.\n4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project's Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.\n\n## Available Commands\n\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\n\nHere, we'll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\n\n### `yarn`\n\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn bootstrap`\n\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn test:services:start`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project's Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project's Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn clean`\n\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nNow that you've set up your workspace, you're ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\n\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project's tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\n\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Jared Wray",

Here's an example of how to configure it:\n\n### Browser\n\nSay we have the following file `example.html`:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n    <title>Marked Footnote</title>\n\n    <link\n      rel=\"stylesheet\"\n      href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-markdown-css/5.2.0/github-markdown-light.min.css\"\n      integrity=\"sha512-bm684OXnsiNuQSyrxuuwo4PHqr3OzxPpXyhT66DA/fhl73e1JmBxRKGnO/nRwWvOZxJLRCmNH7FII+Yn1JNPmg==\"\n      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n      referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\"\n    />\n\n    <style>\n      #content {\n        margin: 0 auto;\n        padding: 1rem;\n        max-width: 928px;\n      }\n\n      .sr-only {\n        position: absolute;\n        width: 1px;\n        height: 1px;\n        padding: 0;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);\n        word-wrap: normal;\n        border: 0;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n\n  <body class=\"markdown-body\">\n    <div id=\"content\"></div>\n\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"./dist/index.umd.cjs\"></script>\n    <script>\n      const md = `# Example\n\n[^1]: This is a footnote content.\n\nHere is a simple footnote[^1].

You can write a footnote right\n> after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render\n> at the bottom of the Markdown.\n\nAnd our module `example.js` looks as follows:\n\n```js\nimport { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'\nimport { Marked } from 'marked'\nimport markedFootnote from 'marked-footnote'\n\nconst html = new Marked()\n  .use(markedFootnote())\n  .parse(readFileSync('example.md', 'utf8'))\n\nconsole.log(html)\n```\n\nNow, running node `example.js` yields:\n\n```html\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<p>\n  Here is a simple footnote<sup\n    ><a\n      id=\"footnote-ref-1\"\n      href=\"#footnote-1\"\n      data-footnote-ref\n      aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\"\n      >1</a\n    ></sup\n  >.

So you will need to add the style as shown below to your CSS:\n\n```css\n[data-footnote-ref]::before {\n  content: '[';\n}\n\n[data-footnote-ref]::after {\n  content: ']';\n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe marked-footnote extension accepts the following configuration options:\n\n- `prefixId`: The prefix ID for footnotes. Defaults to `'footnote-'`.\n\n- `description`: The description of footnotes, used by `aria-labeledby` attribute. Defaults to `'Footnotes'`.\n\n- `refMarkers`: If set to `true`, it will place footnote reference in square brackets, like this: `[1]`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhen considering the use of footnotes in your content, it's important to keep in mind the following accessibility and usability factors:\n\n1. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Screen readers may not effectively convey footnotes. They tend to read the footnote number without indicating that it's a footnote or using superscript. Additionally, they may not identify the link to the footnote text.\n2. **Accessibility Challenges**: Footnotes pose challenges for all users on a web page. To access them, one often needs to scroll to the end of the page, read the footnote, and then click back to the main content. Not everyone is aware that they should click on the footnote at the end, potentially causing them to lose their place. Moreover, if the same footnote is repeated multiple times, clicking on the link could lead to the wrong location.\n\nIf you find it necessary to utilize footnotes, here are some best practices to follow:\n\n- **Numeric Format**: Use numbers for your footnotes rather than typographical symbols or special characters.\n- **Square Bracket Markers**: Place footnote markers in square brackets, like this: `[1]`.\n- **Avoid Superscript**: Do not use superscript formatting for your footnote markers.\n\n## Related\n\nSee [extensions list](https://github.com/bent10/marked-extensions#packages).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe 💛&nbsp; issues.\n\nWhen committing, please conform to [the semantic-release commit standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Please install `commitizen` and the adapter globally, if you have not already.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g commitizen cz-conventional-changelog\n```\n\nNow you can use `git cz` or just `cz` instead of `git commit` when committing. You can also use `git-cz`, which is an alias for `cz`.\n\n```bash\ngit add . && git cz\n```\n\n## License\n\n![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/bent10/marked-extensions)\n\nA project by [Stilearning](https://stilearning.com) &copy; 2023.",

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>",

    "licenseText": "# napi-wasm\n\nAn implementation of the [napi](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) API for WASM. Enables using some native Node modules in browsers and other environments.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo use napi-wasm, there are a few requirements:\n\n1. Configure your linker to export an indirect function table. With ldd, this is the `--export-table` flag. This enables JavaScript to call callback functions registered by WASM. It is exposed in the WebAssembly exports as `__indirect_function_table`.\n2. Export a function from your WASM build named `napi_register_module_v1` (Node's default), or `napi_register_wasm_v1` for WASM-specific builds. This is called during initialization to setup the `exports` object for your module. It receives an environment and an exports object pointer as arguments, which you can add properties to.\n3. Include a function named `napi_wasm_malloc` in your WASM build. This is called from JavaScript by napi-wasm to allocate memory in the WASM heap. It should accept a `uint32` size argument indicating the number of bytes to allocate, and return a `uint8` pointer to allocated memory.\n4. Compile for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\n\n### In Rust\n\nThe above steps should apply for any programming language, but here's an example in Rust. First, define a `napi_wasm_malloc` function so JavaScript can allocate memory in the WASM heap using the default allocator.\n\n```rust\nuse std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn napi_wasm_malloc(size: usize) -> *mut u8 {\n  let align = std::mem::align_of::<usize>();\n  if let Ok(layout) = Layout::from_size_align(size, align) {\n    unsafe {\n      if layout.size() > 0 {\n        let ptr = alloc(layout);\n        if !ptr.is_null() {\n          return ptr;\n        }\n      } else {\n        return align as *mut u8;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  std::process::abort();\n}\n```\n\nNext, implement `napi_register_wasm_v1` to register your module exports. We'll use the [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) bindings in this example to make it a bit nicer than calling C APIs directly. Note that the napi-rs `#[module_exports]` macro currently doesn't work in WASM because Rust doesn't support ctor setup functions in WASM targets yet, so we'll need to do this manually.\n\n```rust\nuse napi::{Env, JsObject, NapiValue};\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub unsafe extern \"C\" fn napi_register_wasm_v1(raw_env: napi::sys::napi_env, raw_exports: napi::sys::napi_value) {\n  let env = Env::from_raw(raw_env);\n  let exports = JsObject::from_raw_unchecked(raw_env, raw_exports);\n\n  exports.create_named_method(\"transform\", transform);\n}\n\n#[js_function(1)]\nfn transform(ctx: CallContext) -> napi::Result<JsUnknown> {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nTo compile, you need to export a function table and use the correct target.\n\n```shell\n RUSTFLAGS=\"-C link-arg=--export-table\" cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown\n```\n\nThis will output a file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/YOUR_CRATE.wasm` which you can load in a JavaScript environment.\n\nYou can also put the rust flags in a `.cargo/config.toml` file so you don't need to provide the environment variable each time you run `cargo build`.\n\n```toml\n[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]\nrustflags = [\"-C\", \"link-arg=--export-table\"]\n```\n\n### Loading\n\nTo load a WASM file and initialize a napi environment, you'll need to import the `napi-wasm` package. You instantiate a WASM module as usual, providing `napi` as the `env` import key. This provides the napi functions for your WASM module to use.\n\nThen, pass the WASM instance to the `Environment` constructor to setup a napi environment. This will call `napi_register_wasm_v1` or `napi_register_module_v1` to setup the exports object. Then you can call functions on the exports object as you would in Node.\n\n```js\nimport { Environment, napi } from 'napi-wasm';\n\n// Construct a URL and instantiate a WebAssembly module as usual.\nconst url = new URL('path/to/lib.wasm', import.meta.url);\nconst { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), {\n  env: napi\n});\n\n// Create an environment.\nlet env = new Environment(instance);\nlet exports = env.exports;\n\n// Use exports as usual!\nexports.transform({\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nWhen you are done with an `Environment`, call the `destroy()` function to clean up memory.",

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

This means `readline2` change some behaviors and as so is **not** meant to be an exact drop-in replacement.\n\nThis project is extracted from the core of [Inquirer.js interactive prompt interface](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) to be available as a standalone module.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Installation**: `npm install --save readline2`\n\n### readline2.createInterface(options); -> {Interface}\n\nPresent the same API as [Node.js `readline.createInterface()`](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)\n\n#### Improvements\n- Default `options.input` as `process.stdin`\n- Default `options.output` as `process.stdout`\n- `interface.stdout` is wrapped in a [MuteStream](https://github.com/isaacs/mute-stream)\n- Prevent `up` and `down` keys from moving through history inside the readline\n- Fix cursor position after a line refresh when the `Interface` prompt contains ANSI colors\n- Correctly return the cursor position when faced with implicit line returns\n\n\nLicense\n-------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Simon Boudrias (twitter: [@vaxilart](https://twitter.com/Vaxilart))\nLicensed under the MIT license.",

    "licenseText": "# RxJS Lite Module #\n\nThe Reactive Extensions for JavaScript Lite version is a lightweight version of the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript which covers most of the day to day operators you might use all in a single library.  Functionality such as bridging to events, promises, callbacks, Node.js-style callbacks, time-based operations and more are built right in.  This comes with `rx.lite.js` which is for use in modern development environments such as > IE9 and server-side environments such as Node.js.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere are a number of ways to get

lots of ways to contribute to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/wiki/Contributors).  If you wish to contribute, check out our [style guide]((https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/contributing)).\n\nYou can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Rx Team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

for advanced users and use cases.\n\n## Using Task Promises\n\nEach task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each\nstep in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a\n`Promise` chain.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\n\n// chain together tasks to await final result\nawait git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');\n\n// or await each step individually\nawait git.init();\nawait git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');\n```\n\n### Catching errors in async code\n\nTo catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ntry {\n   await git.init();\n   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);\n} catch (e) {\n   /* handle all errors here */\n}\n```\n\nor catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than\njumping to the final `catch` on the first error:\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ntry {\n   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);\n   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);\n} catch (e) {\n   /* handle all errors here */\n}\n\nfunction ignoreError() {}\n```\n\n## Using Task Callbacks\n\nIn addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument\nto handle the result of the task.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ngit.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);\n\nfunction onInit(err, initResult) {}\nfunction onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}\n```\n\nIf any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the\n[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .\n\n## Task Responses\n\nWhether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the\n`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.\n\nFor type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).\n\n# Upgrading from Version 2\n\nFrom v3 of `simple-git` you can now import as an ES module, Common JS module or as TypeScript with bundled type\ndefinitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated\nin v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).\n\n# API\n\n|

Use the `.installed` property of the result to determine whether `git` is accessible on the path.\n\n## changing the working directory [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-change-working-directory.md)\n\n-  `.cwd(workingDirectory)` Sets the working directory for all future commands - note, this will change the working for the root instance, any chain created from the root will also be changed.\n-  `.cwd({ path, root = false })` Sets the working directory for all future commands either in the current chain of commands (where `root` is omitted or set to `false`) or in the main instance (where `root` is `true`).\n\n## How to Specify Options\n\nWhere the task accepts custom options (eg: `pull` or `commit`), these can be supplied as an object, the keys of which\nwill all be merged as trailing arguments in the command string, or as a simple array of strings.\n\n### Options as an Object\n\nWhen the value of the property in the options object is a `string`, that name value\npair will be included in the command string as `name=value`. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });\n\n// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });\n```\n\n### Options as an Array\n\nOptions can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands\nin the same way as when an object is used:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);\n```\n\n# Release History\n\nMajor release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as\nwith TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your\napplication hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.\n\nSee also:\n\n- [release notes v3](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/CHANGELOG.md)\n- [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)\n\n# Concurrent / Parallel Requests\n\nWhen the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful\nfor when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:\n\n```typescript\nsimpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();\n```\n\nEach task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a\nstep of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.\n\nWhen the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained\noff another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful\nfor when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:\n\n```typescript\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst results = await Promise.all([\n   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),\n   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),\n]);\nfunction swallow(err) {\n   return null;\n}\n```\n\nEach `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and\nmanages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the\n`simpleGit` function, eg:\n\n```typescript\nconst git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });\n```\n\nTreating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of\n`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.\n\n# Complex Requests\n\nWhen no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly\nusing `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:\n\n```javascript\nconst path = '/path/to/repo';\nconst commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];\n\n// using an array of commands and node-style callback\nsimpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {\n   // err is null unless this command failed\n   // result is the raw output of this command\n});\n\n// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback\nconst result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);\n\n// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses\nconst result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);\n```\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:\n\n```javascript\nconst USER = 'something';\nconst PASS = 'somewhere';\nconst REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';\n\nconst remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .clone(remote)\n   .then(() => console.log('finished'))\n   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));\n```\n\nBe sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication\nto ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.\n\n# Environment Variables\n\nPass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which\nsupports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:\n\n```javascript\nconst GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)\n   .status((err, status) => {\n      /*  */\n   });\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })\n   .status()\n   .then((status) => {})\n   .catch((err) => {});\n```\n\nNote - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`\nvariables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.\n\n# Exception Handling\n\nWhen the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a\nsuccessful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no\navailable parser to handle the error or a\n`GitResponseError` for when there is.\n\nSee the `err` property of the callback:\n\n```javascript\ngit.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {\n   if (err.git) {\n      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary\n   }\n});\n```\n\nCatch errors with try/catch in async code:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();\n   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);\n} catch (err) {\n   // err.message - the string summary of the error\n   // err.stack - some stack trace detail\n   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content\n\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\nCatch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:\n\n```javascript\nconst mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {\n   if (err.git) {\n      return err.git;\n   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary\n   throw err; // some other error, so throw\n});\n\nif (mergeSummary.failed) {\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\nWith typed errors available in TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nimport { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';\ntry {\n   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();\n   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);\n} catch (err) {\n   // err.message - the string summary of the error\n   // err.stack - some stack trace detail\n   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content\n   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;\n   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];\n\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\n# Troubleshooting / FAQ\n\n### Enable logging\n\nSee the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md) for logging examples and how to\nmake use of the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library's programmatic interface\nin your application.\n\n### Enable Verbose Logging\n\nSee the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for\nthe full list of verbose logging options to use with the\n[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.\n\n### Every command returns ENOENT error message\n\nThere are a few potential reasons:\n\n-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used\n   with the `.customBinary(...)` API option.\n\n-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible\n   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses\n   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,\n   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:\n\n   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`\n\n### Log format fails\n\nThe properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending\non the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version\nbefore that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you\nare using.\n\nFor more details of the supported tokens, please see the\n[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)\n\n### Log response properties are out of order\n\nThe properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages\nuse this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`\n\n### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files\n\n-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`\n-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)\n-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal\n-  Check the language used in the response is english locale\n\nIn some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for\n`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.\n\n### Legacy Node Versions\n\nFrom `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will\nresult in errors such as:\n\n-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`\n-  `Object.entries is not a function`\n-  `message.flatMap is not a function`\n\nTo resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills\nfrom `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).\n\n# Examples\n\n### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task\n\nIf the `simple-git` API doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to\nbe added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:\n\n```typescript\nimport { simpleGit, pathspec } from \"simple-git\";\n\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();\nconst subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status([pathspec('sub-dir')]);\nconst subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ 'sub-dir': pathspec('sub-dir') });\n```\n\n### async await\n\n```javascript\nasync function status(workingDir) {\n   let statusSummary = null;\n   try {\n      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();\n   } catch (e) {\n      // handle the error\n   }\n\n   return statusSummary;\n}\n\n// using the async function\nstatus(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));\n```\n\n### Initialise a git repo if necessary\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit(__dirname);\n\ngit.checkIsRepo()\n   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))\n   .then(() => git.fetch());\n\nfunction initialiseRepo(git) {\n   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));\n}\n```\n\n### Update repo and get a list of tags\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')\n   .pull()\n   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));\n\n// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app\nsimpleGit().pull((err, update) => {\n   if (update && update.summary.changes) {\n      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n   }\n});\n```\n\n### Starting a new repo\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .init()\n   .add('./*')\n   .commit('first commit!')\n   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')\n   .push('origin', 'master');\n```\n\n### push with `-u`\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .add('./*')\n   .commit('first commit!')\n   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')\n   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));\n```\n\n### Piping to the console for long-running tasks\n\nSee [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on\nlogging progress updates.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit({\n   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {\n      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);\n   },\n});\ngit.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');\n```\n\n### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app\n\n```javascript\n// when using a chain\nsimpleGit()\n   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))\n   .pull((err, update) => {\n      if (update && update.summary.changes) {\n         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n      }\n   })\n   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));\n\n// when using async and optional chaining\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconsole.log('Starting pull...');\nif ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {\n   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n}\nconsole.log('pull done.');\n```\n\n### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(await simpleGit().log());\nconsole.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));\n```\n\n### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')\n   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')\n   .commit('committed as \"Some One\"', 'file-one')\n   .commit('committed as \"Another Person\"', 'file-two', {\n      '--author': '\"Another Person <another@person.com>\"',\n   });\n```\n\n### Get remote repositories\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {\n   if (!err) {\n      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');\n      console.log(data);\n   }\n});\n```",

    "licenseText": "# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n\n> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets\n\nYou may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).\n\nThe massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in \"dev\" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.\n\nThis middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.\n\n:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save sirv\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst sirv = require('sirv');\nconst polka = require('polka');\nconst compress = require('compression')();\n\n// Init `sirv` handler\nconst assets = sirv('public', {\n  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y\n  immutable: true\n});\n\npolka()\n  .use(compress, assets)\n  .use('/api', require('./api'))\n  .listen(3000, err => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');\n  });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### sirv(dir, opts={})\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nThe returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.\n\nWhen defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.\n\n#### dir\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `.`\n\nThe directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.\n\n#### opts.dev\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnable \"dev\" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.\n\nAdditionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.\n\n> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!\n\n#### opts.etag\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nGenerate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.\n\n> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.\n\n#### opts.dotfiles\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).\n\n> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.\n\n#### opts.extensions\nType: `Array<String>`<br>\nDefault: `['html', 'htm']`\n\nThe file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!\n\n> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.\n\n#### opts.gzip\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include \"gzip\" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.gz',\n  '/index.htm.gz',\n  '/index.html',\n  '/index.htm',\n]);\n```\n\n\n#### opts.brotli\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either \"br\" or \"brotli\" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\nWhen both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.br'\n  '/index.htm.br'\n  '/index.html.gz'\n  '/index.htm.gz'\n  '/index.html'\n  '/index.htm'\n]);\n```\n\n#### opts.maxAge\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nEnables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>\nFor example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.\n\n#### opts.immutable\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAppends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!\n\n> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!\n\n#### opts.single\nType: `Boolean` or `String`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nTreat the directory as a single-page application.\n\nWhen `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>\nYou may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.\n\nFor example, if \"/about\" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for \"/\" is sent instead:\n\n```js\n// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening\n\n// Request: \"/about\"\nlet file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);\nif (file) {\n  send(file);\n} else if (opts.single === true) {\n  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);\n  send(file);\n} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {\n  file = find([opts.single]);\n  send(file);\n} else {\n  // next() or 404\n}\n```\n\n#### opts.ignores\nType: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`\n\nSpecify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.\n\nBy default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.\n\nAdditionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.\n\nAny string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.\n\nFinally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).\n\n> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.\n\n#### opts.onNoMatch\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.\n\nThe function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.\n\n> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.\n\n#### opts.setHeaders\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.\n\nIts signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)",

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",
